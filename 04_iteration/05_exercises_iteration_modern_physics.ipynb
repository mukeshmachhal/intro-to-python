The LLM was provided the chapter contents and asked to propose appropriate exercises based on concepts from Modern Physics. Prof. McDonough then selected the most pedagogically relevant exercises and prompted the LLM to create a Jupyter notebook with appropriate notes and the selected exercises. The generated content was read thoroughly for accuracy and changes were made. \n",

To make it easier, the .py file should be in the same directory as this notebook. To the directory with the .py file, add a file with the name '__init__.py' (this file can be empty other than the name). Then, use `import` to import your functions from the .py file.\n",
